# File organization

There are four folders in this directory ANN/Ishara

## 1) Scripts
This contains two python scripts.

* [Python_Script_for_Plots.ipynb] To generate plots from an indivudal setting: Note that this uses the rest of the files to generate "F values" and make sure you have "tensorflow" 
installed before running the code, otherwise feel free to modify it to generate everything (ReE, ReH, ReHtilde) without F.
* [Python_Script_for_Plots_with_txtFiles.ipynb] To generate summary plots using the txt files generated by the above script

**Note that you will have to provide the correct path to the results (.csv) files that you obtained**


## 2) Results
This folder contains all .csv files with the combinations (options) that that were tried so far (organized by folders for each setting)
