# Pseudo Data generator:

## 1) Version 1
In the folder Version_1, the pseudo data generator produce pseudo data with kinematics mimicking JLAB data (195 sets) and the CFF values are generated using KM15 model.

## 2) Version 2
In the folder Version_2, the pseudo data generator produce pseudo data with discrete and arbitrary kinematics and the CFF values are also generated using arbitrary model.


## 3) Version 3
In the folder Version_3, the pseudo data generator produce pseudo data using the following two options,
### a) discrete and arbitrary kinematics and the CFF values are also generated using arbitrary model
### b) kinematics and CFFs from a pre-generated .csv file
