# Pseudo Data generator:

## 1) Version 1
In the folder Version_1, the pseudo data generator produce pseudo data with kinematics mimicking JLAB data (195 sets) and the CFF values are generated using KM15 model.

## 2) Version 2
In the folder Version_2, the pseudo data generator produce pseudo data with discrete and arbitrary kinematics and the CFF values are also generated using arbitrary model.


## 3) Version 3
In the folder Version_3, the pseudo data generator produce pseudo data using the following two options,
a) discrete and arbitrary kinematics and the CFF values are also generated using arbitrary model
b) kinematics and CFFs from a pre-generated .csv file
* Note: BHDVCS_formalism.py contains different formalisms which can be called by the script pseudogen.py


## 4) Version 4
In the folder Version_4, the pseudo data generator produce pseudo data using the following two options,
a) discrete and arbitrary kinematics and the CFF values are also generated using arbitrary model
b) kinematics and CFFs from a pre-generated .csv file
c) User can define which formalism (among BKM02, BKM10) to use for psuedodata generation in pseudogen.py
* Note: BHDVCS_formalism.py contains different formalisms which can be called by the script pseudogen.py
