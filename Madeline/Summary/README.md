# Pseudo Data generation, varying smear error, and analysis:

## Step 1) Make Pseudo Data
Make pseudo data using BKM10
* Note: Files modified from Github (ANN/PseudoData_Generation/Version_5)

## Step 2) Make Many Sets of Data
Vary smear error to make multiple sets of pseudo data. Example done for one set of errors: 0.0, 0.01, 0.05, 0.1 (recommend doing a lot more sets and including a larger range of smear errors).

## Step 3) Analysis
Examines how Err on F impacts deviation and accuracy
* Note: Files modified from Github (ANN/Aaryan/ErrF Experiments/BKM02)

## Possible Next Steps
* Run analysis that averages data over multiple sets with the same smear error
* Make many sets of data, though now varying phi, and run anaysis
* Observe how the scarcity of data points effects limits to the goodness of fit
