# Pseudo Data generation, varying smear error, and analysis:

## Step 1) Make Pseudo Data
Make pseudo data using BKM10
* Note: Files modified from Github (ANN/PseudoData_Generation/Version_5)

## Step 2) Make Data
Vary smear error to make multiple sets of pseudo data


## Step 3) Analysis
In the folder Version_3, the pseudo data generator produce pseudo data using the following two options,
a) discrete and arbitrary kinematics and the CFF values are also generated using arbitrary model
b) kinematics and CFFs from a pre-generated .csv file
