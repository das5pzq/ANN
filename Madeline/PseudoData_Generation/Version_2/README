This is a python code to generate pseudo data with some discrete and arbitrary kinematics and arbritary model of the Compton Form Factors. 
To use it:
module load anaconda
python pseudogen2.py

The code require several input:
Line 12-15 for the kinematics input
Line 17 for the number of phi in each kinematics set
Line 49-54 for the CFFs model and smearing error

The structure of the output/generated file:
Set, index, k, qq, xb, t, phi, F, errorF,  F1, F2, gReH, gReE, gReHTilde, gc0fit
