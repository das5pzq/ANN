WARNING:tensorflow:5 out of the last 5 calls to <function BHDVCStf.setKinematics at 0x2b6422e13ef0> triggered tf.function retracing. Tracing is expensive and the excessive number of tracings is likely due to passing python objects instead of tensors. Also, tf.function has experimental_relax_shapes=True option that relaxes argument shapes that can avoid unnecessary retracing.
